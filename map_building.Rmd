I think we'll also need the "maps" and "maptools" packages

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(plotly)
library(devtools)
library(leaflet)
library(patchwork)
```

Merge data sets

```{r}
cleaned_wfls = 
  read_csv("./data/cleaned_wfls.csv")

zipcodes =
  read_xlsx("./data/zip_codes.xlsx") %>% 
  mutate(zipcode = as.character(zipcode))

merged_wfls = 
  left_join(cleaned_wfls, zipcodes, by = "zipcode")

write.csv(wfls_df, "./data/merged_wfls.csv")
```
